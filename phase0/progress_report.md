### Daniel

### Kaartik - Implemented SearchForPLayer and helped implement SearchByPlayerAttributes. Assisted with InputPlayerAttributesTest and Players Class and resolve simple errors and warnings in Input classes. Researched and found the dataset. In the future I would like to work and delve deeper into scouting algorithms which would enrich the user experience and also make the scouting system advanced. Would also like to work on reducing the runtime and load of the program.

### Matthew

### Michael - Implemented CsvAdapter and PlayerDatabase, assisted with implementing Player and reformating the Specification. Researched  and found data sources and querying approcahes. In the future I would like to stick to the data side of things, and reimplement PlayerDatabase, TeamDatabase, CsvAdapter when we have more features and more complex and heavy data, I'd also be interested in implementing a more sophisticated search algorithms in the search classes.
