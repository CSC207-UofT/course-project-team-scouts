# Progress Report

## Summary of Specification and Program

## What's Working?

(what parts of our program/design are working well?)

## What Isn't?

(explain difficulties encountered, questions that have come up)

## Group Member Roles

(what have you done, and what will you work on?)

- the original specification and all the CRC cards were a collaborative effort

### Aditya
Worked on the unittest, and helped create the entity class Team. I also helped Kaartik implement the SearchForPlayer class and worked with Matthew to find a way to display data in the Players Presenter class. In the future I would like to do some more research and find a way to implement GetSearchQuery, modify or rework on InputPlayerAttributes and analyze how we could put implement and put the StatsCalculator interface to use.

### Daniel

### Kaartik - Implemented SearchForPLayer and helped implement SearchByPlayerAttributes. Assisted with InputPlayerAttributesTest and Players Class and resolve simple errors and warnings in Input classes. Researched and found the dataset. In the future I would like to work and delve deeper into scouting algorithms which would enrich the user experience and also make the scouting system advanced. Would also like to work on reducing the runtime and load of the program.

### Matthew
Worked on the `Player` and `Scout` entity classes. Also 
implemented the Presenter functionality, creating the `PresentData`
interface and implementing the `PlayersPresenter` class. Researched how to
output data in a tabular fashion and format strings in order to present results of a search
in the most readable way possible. Past Phase 0, I plan to continue
working on the Presenter functionality, implementing a presenter class
that works to output data about entire Teams, and another
presenter class that returns result of a search for a singular
player. Additionally, I would like to help out with the development
of classes that calculate and present statistics aggregated across
entire Teams, and participate in refining the existing search processes
in the program.

### Michael
=======
### Michael - Implemented CsvAdapter and PlayerDatabase, assisted with implementing Player and reformating the Specification. Researched  and found data sources and querying approcahes. In the future I would like to stick to the data side of things, and reimplement PlayerDatabase, TeamDatabase, CsvAdapter when we have more features and more complex and heavy data, I'd also be interested in implementing a more sophisticated search algorithms in the search classes.
