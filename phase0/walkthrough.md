# Scenario Walk-Through

The user is presented with an input prompt which asks them for a search query. The user can specify a specific 
player’s name or choose to search by player attributes. In the latter case, suppose the user is looking for a 
midfielder, the user would subsequently input the specifications of the type of midfielder he is looking for – 
like net worth, passing, dribbling, etc.

A search query is initiated, and player(s)that meet the specifications outlined by the users are scouted by utilizing
our scouting algorithm. The potential midfielders are then displayed (write something about how our output would look),
along with their attributes.
